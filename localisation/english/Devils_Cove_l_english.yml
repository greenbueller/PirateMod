 # Events

 Devils_Cove.1.t:0 "The Fourth Otavin Congress"
 Devils_Cove.1.d:0 "On [GetDateText], the Otavin Congress met for their regularly scheduled meeting, with a special address from President Seavey. The politicians all filled into the chambers of Congress as usual, and all was well."
 Devils_Cove.1.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 Devils_Cove.2.t:0 "The Incident"
 Devils_Cove.2.d:0 "Half way through President Seavey's Address to Congress, a loud bang was heard on the wooden door that led into the Chambers. After, there was loud shouts and more rapid bangs against the door, as more and more people seemed to fill the hallways of the Congress building. From inside the room, President Seavey attempted to retain control of the meeting by carrying on as normal, but after multiple minutes of repeated shouting, even he had to stop. Suddenly, all of the noise stopped as one exceptionally loud man yelled that he demanded an audience with Congress."
 Devils_Cove.2.a:0 "Allow Them To Speak"
 Devils_Cove.2.b:0 "Crush Them At Once!"
 Devils_Cove.3.t:0 "The Peoples Demands"
 Devils_Cove.3.d:0 "[DEV_Demands]"
 Devils_Cove.3.a:0 "Give Into The People"
 Devils_Cove.3.b:0 "These Peasants Know Nothing, Fire At Will!"
 DEV_LISTENED_DEMANDS:0 "After the banging has stopped, President Seavey motions for one of the guards standing next to the door to open the door to this man, allowing him entry into the chamber, with the guards watching him closely to make sure nobody is harmed. The man speaks calmly despite the shouting that had occured just moments ago out in the halls, now ransacked by the people. \"This tyranny by Dictator Seavey has occured for far too long, allow the people a greater say in government, and we will stop. If you refuse us, we will continue to resist your oppression, regardless of what it might cost us individually. We as a collective are stronger than one man can ever hope to be.\"""
 DEV_FIGHT_DEMANDS:0 "After the banging has stopped, Seavey gives a motion for the guards to resist this uprising against his rightful rule as President. Moments later, troops begin to march through the halls, detaining and beating any protestors who refuse to leave the building. Despite this onslaught, the door continues to buckle until it collapses against multiple bodies slamming into it. Out from the splinters steps a man, likely the same one who shouted moments earlier. He calls out calmly, despite the utter chaos going on in the hallways behind him as militiamen and peasants fight each other, \"This tyranny by Dictator Seavey has occured for far too long, allow the people a greater say in government, and we will stop. If you refuse us, we will continue to resist your oppression, regardless of what it might cost us individually. We as a collective are stronger than one man can ever hope to be.\""
 Devils_Cove.4.t:0 "The People's Voice"
 Devils_Cove.4.d:0 "After the man, now identified as Mr. Fernando, gave his rousing speech during the Fourth Otavin Congress, President Seavey has given into the demands given by the people. In the subsequent days, more and more letters arrive in his office, all with the same stamp in the top left corner, the same design as the pin on Mr. Fernando's suit. Each letter calls for better conditions for the working class, and more stable housing. §tThe people demand change§!."
 Devils_Cove.4.a:0 "We Stand In Solidarty."
 Devils_Cove.5.t:0 "War Is..."
 Devils_Cove.5.d:0 "With the rise of the Worker occuring across the nation, representative Fernando of the people has called for a speech in the city of Tisden. At noon on the 6th, he calls the audience to attention, opening off with a rousing line \"War... What is war? War is what we must do in order to secure our freedoms! We must fight the system if we wish to have any hope of achieving victory over our ruling overlords! Down with the system!\""
 Devils_Cove.5.a:0 "War Is Forever!"
 Devils_Cove.6.t:0 "The Peoples War"
 Devils_Cove.6.d:0 "Representative Fernando gives a pause after that line, and the croud erupts into yelling and applause, with one chant being heard throughout Golden Plaza, \"War Is Forever!\". Waving his hand down, Fernando waits for the crowd to calm before continuing into the next section of his speech. \"We the people, the working class, the producers of capital, are rightly owed the capital we produce. Our ownership of the means of production is bestowed upon us by God himself. God shall lead us to victory! Our victory will outweight the losses! We are one! Down with the system!\""
 Devils_Cove.6.a:0 "Our Victory Is Guaranteed!"
 Devils_Cove.7.t:0 "The War Begins Today!"
 Devils_Cove.7.d:0 "Days after Representative Fernando's speech in Golden Plaza, yet another speech is called, this time outside the Governor's Mansion in Greater Tisden. Representative Fernando stands atop a hastily constructed platform, with armed members of the WIA behind him to prevent any federal intervention by the Governor. As people begin to file around the box, a respectful distance from the great orator, he begins his speech, the one that will start a new era. \"To the people of Devils Cove, we have been subject to the Capitalist boot for far too long! Today, we rise up against the bourgeoisie! Today, we fight for our rights! Today, we form our own Republic, one ruled by the people, for the people, by the people! Today, we go to war! Fight for your rights, comrades. We have nothing to lose but our chains!\" The crowd erupts in yelling as the now-President Fernando walks away with his escort, into a carriage waiting nearby, and leaves the crowd to their fervor."
 Devils_Cove.7.a:0 "To War We Go!"
 Devils_Cove.8.t:0 "An Invitation"
 Devils_Cove.8.d:0 "Hours ago, a delegation arrived from the Tisden Worker's Republic. After they were settled, they requested a meeting with [ROOT.GetLeader]. During this meeting, they proposed that we join the new military and economic alliance formed called the Oceanic Workers Alliance. They patiently await our decision."
 Devils_Cove.8.a:0 "We accept"
 Devils_Cove.8.b:0 "We decline"
 Devils_Cove.9.t:0 "Request to join [ROOT.GetFactionName]"
 Devils_Cove.9.d:0 "Hours ago, a delegation arrived from the Tisden Worker's Republic. After they were settled, they requested a meeting with [ROOT.GetLeader]. During this meeting, they requested that we be invited into [ROOT.GetFactionName] to ensure global security against the encroaching Fascist threat to all of us. They patiently await our decision."
 Devils_Cove.10.t:0 "The Letters..."
 Devils_Cove.10.d:0 "After our brave soldiers opened fire on the crowd, they began to scurry away into the plaza around the Congressional building, however one of our Lieutenants found a letter, left completely intact despite the rampaging mob, on the floor near the main doorway. On the letter is a stamp, the same as the man who dared to stand up to his Presidency. The next day, another letter arrives, then another, all with the same stamp. Each letter calls for improvements to the lives of the working class, and stable housing. §tThe people demand change§!."
 Devils_Cove.10.a:0 "Only the strong shall survive, crush these weaklings!"
 Devils_Cove.11.t:0 "He Who Serves Best"
 Devils_Cove.11.d:0 "Following the recent brutal crushing of the Peasantry in their attempt to establish a new regime, Her Majesty Princess Alson has spoken out against President Seavey's actions, calling for her installation as leader of the nation in order to ensure the situation is handled properly. President Seavey has fired back stating that she has no right to the country, being a Monarch of a foreign nation with no formal ties to Devils Cove, despite him being an exiled criminal from abroad. Now the question remains, who shall lead the nation in this turbulent time?"
 Devils_Cove.11.a:0 "The Exiled One"
 Devils_Cove.11.b:0 "The Princess"
